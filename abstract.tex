	While several breakthroughs in image processing using large datasets were made over the past years, 
	current approaches in the domain of few shot classification in images may benefit by the recent 
	advances in deep learning. Specifically, this work explores the use of the novel self-supervised \gls{ijepa}
	in few shot classification serving as a proof of concept for applications in smart ovens and as a starting point 
	for further improvements. This work compares the usefulness of the resulting representations of the 
	\gls{ijepa} with an established baseline model using a base learner that is trained during validation 
	on few held-out samples. It is shown that learned representations from the \gls{ijepa} improves 
	average accuracy in cross-validation using logistic regression as a base learner. Further research is needed,
	to conclude the usefulness of the \gls{ijepa} as an embedding model in food images. Ideas and an outlook 
	for further improvements are discussed. The source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/roestii/dlvsp_homework}.
