Results shown in \cite{tian_rethinking_2020}, even for the baseline (without distilling a ResNet-18) suggest accuracy 
scores on CIFAR around 71.5\% and 5-shot accuracy of 86\%. These results seem far more promising than the 
ones encountered in this work. Other works that use the Food-101 dataset directly like \cite{jiang_few-shot_2020} achieved
one shot accuracy scores of 55\% with multi-view representation learning. This might suggest that the Food-101 
dataset is relatively hard for few show classification. It can be attributed to the use of real-world examples in the 
dataset which suffer high variance \cite{fleet_food-101_2014}.
Furthermore, it has to be noted that the tests in \cite{jiang_few-shot_2020} were only performed on 
five randomly sampled classes \cite{jiang_few-shot_2020}
instead of the 15 or 16 classes that were used in this work making the comparison of the findings hard.
Further work is needed to fully conclude, whether the effectiveness of the self-supervised embedding model
and base learner approach can compete with others in few shot classification of food images.
